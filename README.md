# My Topic Google Doodle
My google doodle is plants thriving under a purple hued grow light. The plants are all on a shelf in a gloomy window, a barrel catus, a hoya, a snkae plant, a large rubber tree plant, and a few small plants to fill the space. I plan on animating the leaves, but Iâ€™m not sure if they will all move individually or a as one svg.
